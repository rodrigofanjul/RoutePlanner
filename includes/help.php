<p>To add locations, simply left-click the map or enter an address
  either in the single address field, or in the bulk loader. </p>
  <p>The first location you add is considered to be the start 
  of your journey. If you click 'Calculate Fastest Roundtrip', it will
  also be the end of your trip. If you click 'Calculate Fastest A-Z Trip',
  the last location (the one with the highest number), will be the final
  destination.</p>
  <p>To remove or edit a location, click its marker.</p>
  <p>If more than 15 locations are specified, you are not guaranteed
  to get the optimal solution, but the solution is likely to be close
  to the best possible.</p>
  <p>You can re-arrange
  stops after the route is computed. To do this, open the 'Edit Route'
  section and drag or delete locations.</p>
